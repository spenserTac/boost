            A while back, I was starting a small business and I was looking for passionate bloggers to advertise with. I soon found out that there was only two options:
            I either had to do tons of cold calls or hire a professional agency to help me. Both of these options were not something I wanted to do. Cold calls were way too time
            consuming and I didn't have the money to hire an agency.
            <br>
            <br>
            I contacted some friends that operated smaller to mid sized blogs and asked them how their experience with finding and recieving sponsorship was. After talking with them,
            it became clear that it's also difficult and tedius for bloggers to find and receive sponsorship.
            <br>
            <br>
            So ... I founded Boost.
            <br>
            <br>
            I started the platform on my own for a while, spending all waking hours programming and brainstorming new ideas. I then put a team together to create and desgin the finalized product.
            <br>
            <br>
            As someone who knows the difficulties of finding and recieving sponsorship, my mission is to revolutionize the industry by providing creators (bloggers) and sponsors (business owners)
            with an easy to use, trust-worthy, safe and streamlined solution to the problems of sponsorship.
